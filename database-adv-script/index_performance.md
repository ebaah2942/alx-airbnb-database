ðŸ”Ž Before Indexing

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * 
FROM bookings 
WHERE user_id = 5 
ORDER BY check_in_date DESC;

Expect higher cost, sequential scan, slower time.


âœ… After Adding Indexes

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * 
FROM bookings 
WHERE user_id = 5 
ORDER BY check_in_date DESC;

You should now see:

Index Scan instead of Seq Scan

Lower cost

Improved execution time
